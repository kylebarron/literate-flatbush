Spatial indexes, and RTrees specifically, are at the core of geospatial software engineering.

_But ever wondered how an RTree is actually implemented?_

This repo is a ["literate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
fork of the upstream [Flatbush](https://github.com/mourner/flatbush) RTree
library.

This was forked from commit [`4ab68d7`](https://github.com/mourner/flatbush/commit/4ab68d7e11607dba0e814efe50fb3583c69f90d6) under the ISC license.
